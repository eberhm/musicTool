The intention of this project is to collect a set of basic tools to help when learning guitar

# List of tools

## Random notes

This tool can help you practice learning the fretboard. I'm using this as base for the exercises:

To run it just run in the terminal:

```
npm run randomNotes <bpm>
```

Default bpm is 35. You do not need to specify it for that speed.

It is recommended you augment the size of the terminal fonts A LOT for better experience ;)
